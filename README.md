This Machine Learning project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of tweets. 
The goal is to classify tweets into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.

project Objectives:
Data Preprocessing
i.Clean the dataset using various preprocessing techniques.
Tokenization:
ii.Tokenize each tweet using appropriate nltk functions.
Feature Extraction:
iii.Apply TF-IDF Vectorization to transform tokens into numerical feature vectors.
Model Training:
iv.Train multiple ML models using twitter_training.csv:
a)Support Vector Machine (SVM)
b)Decision Tree
c)Random Forest
d)Multinomial Naive Bayes
Hyperparameter Tuning:
v.Use grid search or cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters for each model.
Model Evaluation:
vi.Test the models using twitter_validation.csv.
vii.Evaluate performance using metrics such as:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-score
Confusion Matrix

Visualization:

ix.Visualize model performance using plots (e.g., confusion matrix heatmaps, bar charts).

Conclusion:

x.Identify and recommend the best performing algorithm.
Tools & Libraries:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
NLTK
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
